    <h1>Privacy Policy for StudyCore</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: May 5, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using StudyCore (studycore.kesug.com). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our website.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>

    <p>Currently, all data and information related to your use of StudyCore are stored locally on your own system. We do not collect or store any of your personal data on our servers through your general use of the website.</p>

    <h2>Email Collection (Support and Feedback Forms)</h2>

    <p>The only personal information we may have access to is your email address, which you voluntarily provide when you fill out our support or feedback forms. This information is used solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiries and improving our services based on your feedback.</p>

    <h2>Use of Your Email Address</h2>

    <p>If you provide your email address through a support or feedback form, we may use it to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respond to your specific support requests.</li>
        <li>Answer your questions or provide clarification.</li>
        <li>Follow up on your feedback to improve StudyCore.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will not use your email address for marketing purposes or share it with third parties unless explicitly required by law.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>Since the majority of your data is stored locally, you are primarily responsible for the security of your own information. We take the security of the limited information we collect (email addresses from support/feedback forms) seriously and will implement reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>

    <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
